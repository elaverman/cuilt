Framework for Local Algorithms used in Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems.


About
-------------------------------------
The package offers a modular framework for developing iterative approximate best-response algorithms for solving DCOPs and several algorithm implementations. [1]

- DSA-A (Distributed Stochastic Algorithm, variants A and B) [1,3]
- DSAN (Distributed Simulated Annealing) [2]
- JSFP-I (Joint Strategy Fictitious Play with Inertia) [4]
- WRM-I (Weighted Regret Monitoring with Inertia) [1,5]

Usage
-------------------------------------
Ensure Java 8 is used for the compilation and install SBT, as described in the README file of the "signal-collect" project.

The project has the following dependencies:
- signal-collect
- signal-collect-torque (only for the evaluation on a cluster)
- signal-collect-slurm (only for the evaluation on a cluster)

Follow the compilation instructions in the "signal-collect" README.

After cloning the repository, go to the project folder and start SBT on the command line. Use the "assembly" command in SBT to generate a .jar file with dependencies.

To generate an Eclipse project, use the "eclipse" command on the SBT prompt and then follow the description in the "How to Develop in Eclipse" section of the "signal-collect" README.

Note
-----
Before submitting a job to a Torque or Slurm host, it is imperative to re-run "assembly" in SBT in order to have the last version of the .jar file run.
